    "<p>You are expected to write code where you see <em># YOUR CODE HERE</em> within the cells of this notebook. Upon submitting your work, the code you write at these designated positions will be assessed using an \"autograder\" that will run a series of tests on your code. You will receive instant feedback from the autograder that will identify issues with and errors in your code. Use this feedback to improve your code if you need to resubmit. Be sure not to change the names of any provided functions, classes, or variables within the existing code cells, as this will interfere with the autograder. Also, remember to execute all code cells, not just those you’ve edited, to ensure the code runs properly.</p>\n",
