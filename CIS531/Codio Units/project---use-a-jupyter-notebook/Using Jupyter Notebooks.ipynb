    "<h2>About this Project</h2>\n",
    "<p>In this project, you will explore a Jupyter notebook, which you will work with in this and future courses. Below, you will find a series of simple exercises to help introduce you to the functionality of a notebook. There is a pop-out drawer to the right of this window which, when clicked, will reveal a guide that covers the basics of using a Jupyter notebook. This guide will be present in any exercise or project that contains a Jupyter notebook. You will also notice a full screen toggle button in the bottom-right corner of this window.</p>\n",

    "<h3>Evaluation</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>This project must be successfully completed and submitted in order to receive credit for this course. Your score on this project will be included in your final grade calculation.</strong><p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>You are expected to write code where you see <em># YOUR CODE HERE</em> within the cells of this notebook. Not all cells will be graded; code input cells followed by cells marked with <em>#Autograder test cell</em> will be graded. Upon submitting your work, the code you write at these designated positions will be assessed using an \"autograder\" that will run all test cells to assess your code. You will receive feedback from the autograder that will identify any errors in your code. Use this feedback to improve your code if you need to resubmit. Be sure not to change the names of any provided functions, classes, or variables within the existing code cells, as this will interfere with the autograder. Also, remember to execute all code cells sequentially, not just those you’ve edited, to ensure your code runs properly.</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>You can resubmit your work as many times as necessary before the submission deadline. If you experience difficulty or have questions about this exercise, use the Q&A discussion board to engage with your peers or seek assistance from the instructor.<p>\n",

    "<p>Before starting your work, please review <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ecornell/global/eCornellPlagiarismPolicy.pdf\">eCornell's policy regarding plagiarism</a> (the presentation of someone else's work as your own without source credit).</p>\n",

    "<h3>Submit Code for Autograder Feedback</h3>\n",

    "<p>Once you have completed your work on this notebook, you will submit your code for autograder review. Follow these steps:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Save your notebook.</strong></li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Mark as Completed —</strong> In the blue menu bar along the top of this code exercise window, you’ll see a menu item called <strong>Education</strong>. In the <strong>Education</strong> menu, click <strong>Mark as Completed</strong> to submit your code for autograder/instructor review. This process will take a moment and a progress bar will show you the status of your submission.</li>\n",
    "\t<li><strong>Review your results —</strong> Once your work is marked as complete, the results of the autograder will automatically be presented in a new tab within the code exercise window. You can click on the assessment name in this feedback window to see more details regarding specific feedback/errors in your code submission.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Repeat, if necessary —</strong> The Jupyter notebook will always remain accessible in the first tabbed window of the exercise. To reattempt the work, you will first need to click <strong>Mark as Uncompleted</strong> in the <strong>Education</strong> menu and then proceed to make edits to the notebook. Once you are ready to resubmit, follow steps one through three. You can repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.</li>\n",
