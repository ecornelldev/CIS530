Find the Conditional Probability


In this exercise, you will need to write a function that assumes conditional independence and determines class-conditional probabilities. Imagine you have the following vector of probabilities of 4 features given a class label c:


P(x|y=c) = [0.212, 0.234, 0.155, .021, .04]

Since we are assuming independence, we can simply multiply these probabilities to get the so-called class conditional probability of observing this data point (i.e. this combination of feature values).

Instructions:

1. Create the array np.array([0.212, 0.234, 0.155, .021, .04]), which corresponds to the likelihood of observing the features x_1 through x_4 conditional on the class label y=c.
2. Compute the product, sum of the logarithms, and exponentiated sum of the logarithms of the probabilities. You may find np.prod, np.sum, np.log and np.exp helpful.  What does this product signify, in terms of probabilities?
3. Answer the multiple choice questions below to check your solution.

Note: You will notice that the product becomes very small quickly, whereas the logarithm stays well above machine precision and is therefore more computationally tractable!
